# Polynomial-Regression
A simple program to calculate the polynomial-regression for a courier company to display the regression of distances covered by the total days driven.

I have used random data figures to assign a x_train, y_train, x_test and y_test.

As per code, I used the LinearRegression() module, theron the quadrant to calculate the linear for the data that displays on the dataplot.
